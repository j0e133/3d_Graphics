# 3D Graphics
This is my 2021 4H project. I created a 3D graphics program using Python. Run the sphere or cubes file for different shapes. You can use the mouse to look around, arrow keys or wasd to move, space to go up and shift to go down. Press esc to exit the program and f to toggle outlines.
Runs on Python version 3.9 with Pygame 2 installed
